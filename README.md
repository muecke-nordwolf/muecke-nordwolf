- 👋 Hi, I’m René, but most people call me Mücke.
  I’m 35 years old, a husband, and a father to wonderful children.

- 🌱 I’m currently retraining to become an IT specialist for system integration and plan to specialize in cybersecurity afterward.  
- 👀 I have a deep passion for cybersecurity and white/gray-hat hacking, constantly exploring the intricate world of network security.
  Beyond the digital realm, I enjoy swimming, and despite my limited mobility, I still find joy in hiking and cherish long summer evenings by the sea.
  I also love reading books, traveling, and sitting by the fire.
   
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
  
- ⚡ Fun facts
  
  I.   I prefer sleeping in very large, extra-long double beds with plenty of space. Probably because, as a truck driver, I always had to rest on 80x200 cm.

  II.  As a so-called “scanner personality” (does that even exist?), I am quickly and broadly enthusiastic, always curious, and eager to learn…

  III. I am a night owl (even though I always wake up early during the week). Late at night, when the lights around me have already gone out, I like to sit at my desk or with a book for a few hours.
       However, I am currently training myself to go to bed earlier. It’s healthier…

  IV.  Cooking is a passion of mine. I also enjoy chopping everything and washing the pots afterward…

  V.   Satire and comedy are totally my thing. I can’t take anything too “sacred,” black-and-white, and uptight seriously.

  VI.  I often take detours because I want to break up rigid routines and see more. I often wonder why many people only know one way home…

  VII. I have sworn that I will laugh at myself until the grave.
